# MazeGame
Created a maze game using dps or bfs from CS2510. \\
A player, using the Eclipse IDE and the libraries given as part of the assignment, would be able to determine the wanted size of the maze to play, then play with the arrow keys to try to find the solution, or press "d" for depth-first search or "b" for breadth-first search. The game would then highlight the optimal path when the end is reached.
